# Project2
My second project for Data Structures



The project2 class implements the other classes with the country object. It first creates all the stacks that seperate the countries by GDP per capital. Next the class inputs the Countries3.csv and splits the data by the comma and the splits the data into separate fields. The class then breaks the country objects into 5 stacks based on GDP per capita. It then pushes only the fair good and vgood groups onto a second stack while popping the other two groups. Then pop from the stack to a Queue the first country is inserted at the front of the Queue then the second country is inserted at the back of the Queue. Then delete the countries that have GDP between 30,000 and 50,000. Remove the countries from the queue to the stack first remove from the front of the list. Then remove from the back of the list and repeat this order. Print the stack and exit the program.
